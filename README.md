RuntimeBrowser
==============

This is a class browser for the Objective-C runtime on iOS and OS X. It gives you full access to all classes loaded in the runtime; allows you to dynamically load new modules and their classes; shows every method implemented on each class; and displays information in a header (.h) file format.

We have found this to be a useful development tool. Please note, however, that each user is responsible for their own usage.

The original version was released in April 2002 by [Ezra Epstein](https://github.com/eepstein). The project is maintained by Nicolas Seriot since August, 2008.

You can browse the [iOS headers](https://github.com/nst/iOS-Runtime-Headers) as seen by RuntimeBrowser.
